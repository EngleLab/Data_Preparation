The Four Data Preparation Steps

1. **Organize the raw data files**. This involves moving the raw *.edat* files from *Tasks/Session #/#. Task/data* to *Data Files/edat/Task/*.

2. **Merge** the individual *.edat* files into a single **task.emrg** file using *E-Merge*

3. **Export** the **task.emrg** file to a **task.txt** file so we can process the data in **R**

4. **Source** the **0_task_raw.R** *Scripts*

The third step in the data preparation stage is to **Export** the **.emrg** to a **.txt** file so it can be imported into R. 

This step is real easy:

1. Open an E-Merged data file in **Data Files/<span style="color: IndianRed">E-Merge</span>**

2. Go to File **<span style="color: IndianRed">Â -> </span>** Export...

3. Change the following options

    **Unicode**: Uncheck
    
4. Select **Okay**

5. Save to the same location as the E-Merged data file: **Data Files/<span style="color: IndianRed">E-Merge</span>**

6. Save with the same filename as the E-Merge file
