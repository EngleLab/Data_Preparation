# Merge

E-Prime will create an **.edat** data file for each subject per task. This results in a lot of separate individual files. We need to merge these files together so that we have **one merged file per task**. We can use the **E-Merge** software program to do so.

The second step in data preparation is to merge the individual **.edat** files into a single **.emrg** file.

The individual subject data files are located in the directory: **Data Files/Subject Files/<span style="color: IndianRed">[Task Name]</span>**

You need to save the merged data files in the directory: **Data Files/<span style="color: IndianRed">Merged</span>**

----

1. Open **E-Merge 3.0** by clicking on the icon in the taskbar.

2. In the left window pane, **navigate to the directory**: 

    Z: Backup Data / [StudyName] / **Data Files / Subject Files**
    
3. Click on the **<span style="color: IndianRed">[Task Name]</span>** folder. This should populate the right window pane with **.edat** files

4. **Select all the files** (Ctrl + A)

5. Click on **Merge** in the toolbar above

6. Select **Standard Merge**

7. A finder window will pop up asking you **Save** the merged data file

    Save the new merged data file with the same name as the **<span style="color: IndianRed">[Task Name]</span>** folder. **Save it to**: 

    Z: Backup Data / [StudyName] / **Data Files / <span style="color: IndianRed">Merged</span>**
    
    If there is no merged file for this task yet, it will ask you if you want to create this file. Select "Yes".
    
9. Get a Graduate Student or PostDoc if an **error** message occurs

10. **Repeat** steps 3 - 9 for each task folder

    - The directory tree in the left window pane may have disappeared. To make it reappear, adjust the horizontal size of the window panes by moving your mouse cursor to the divider between the left and right window panes.

**You should now see E-Merged files for each task located in Data Files / <span style="color: IndianRed">Merged</span>.**
