# Organize

The first step in data preparation is simply about organizing the raw data files so that we can more easily merge the data files using E-Merge.

Initially the data files are stored on separate computers along with the task program and stimulus materials. For each task we need to grab only the data files from each computer and put them into a single folder for that task.

**Because we have many tasks and computers, manually doing this can be quite tedious and error prone.**

I have created R scripts that you can run on each running room computer to copy the data files for each task to the Z drive.

1. Connect the computer to the **internet**

    Do this by plugging in the yellow ethernet cord

2. Connect to the **Z Drive**

    There should be a shortcut to a Z: Drive folder on the Desktop. If you can open that shortcut then the Z Drive is connected. Otherwise it might prompt you to provide credentials. A Grad Student or Post-Doc will have to put in their GT username and password.

3. **Open R**

4. In R, **open copy_raw.R** script file

5. **Run all code** in copy_raw.R

    Use CTRL+A to select all lines, then CTRL+R to run

6. In R, **open copy_to_zdrive.R** script file

7. **Run all code** in copy_to_zdrive.R

    Use CTRL+A to select all lines, then CTRL+R to run
    
8. **Check** the output to see the number of files copied for each task

9. **Unplug** the computer from the **internet**

10. **Repeat** steps 1 - 9 for each running room computer
