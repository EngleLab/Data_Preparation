# Introduction {-}

This is a guide on how to perform the data preparation steps. **There are four chapters** covering each of the steps and an additional chapter for pupil/eye-tracking data.

*Navigate the Chapters from the left-sidebar.*

Before we can start even looking at the data there are some preparatory steps that need to happen. Data Preparation starts out with *messy* raw data files for each individual subject spread across all the computers and ends with *tidy* raw data files (that are easy to work with) with data from all subjects merged into one file for each task.

The four data preparation steps are:

1. **Organize** the raw data files

2. **Merge** the individual *.edat* files into a single **task.emrg** file using *E-Merge*

3. **Export** the task.emrg file to a **task.txt** file so we can process the data in **R**

4. **Tidy** the raw data files by running the **0_task_raw.R** *Scripts*
