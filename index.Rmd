# Introduction {-}

At some point you will need to start analyzing the data. However, you first need to prepare the data so that it is ready to analyze. There are several steps in this processs and it can be quite tedious.

There are two scenarios in which you may need to start processing and analyzing data:

- Before data collection has finished

- After data collection has finished

<br>

For both of these scenarios, there are **4 data preparation steps:**

1. **Organize the raw data files**. This involves moving the raw *.edat* files from *Tasks/Session #/#. Task/data* to *Data Files/edat/Task/*.

2. **Merge** the individual *.edat* files into a single **task.emrg** file using *E-Merge*

3. **Export** the **task.emrg** file to a **task.txt** file so we can process the data in **R**

4. **Source** the **0_task_raw.R** *Scripts*

All the data files related to the study will be in the **Data Collection** folder at:

**Dropbox (GaTech) / EngleLab / Studies / [StudyName] **
